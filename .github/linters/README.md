# Linters

This directory aims to consolidate configuration files from all linters. MegaLinter knows to look for any linter specific configurations in this directory.

## Local Linting

If you have Docker and npm installed locally then you can run MegaLinter using the exact same configuration as the CI runners.

See [MegaLinter docs](https://megalinter.io/latest/mega-linter-runner/) for instructions on local setup.
