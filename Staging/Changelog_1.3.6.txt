New
* Mods that have 'enabled.txt' present in their mod directory are now always loaded regardless of their state in mods.txt.

Lua
* Added better support for StrProperty/FString.
  They can now be set like any other variable (Lua literal strings get auto-converted to FStrings).
  Parameters for "RegisterHook" that are of type FString are now also supported.
* Added support for SoftClassProperty/TSoftClassPtr.
* Added support for FSoftObjectPath and TSoftClassPtr, see API.txt for more information.
* The global function "RegisterHook" now returns two integers that represent pre & post callback ids.
  These ids can be passed to the "UnregisterHook" global function to unhook a function.
* Note that the callbacks for "RegisterHook" and "NotifyOnNewObject" execute in the game thread so the code in these callbacks needs to be careful when accessing Lua variables outside the callbacks.
* Added the global function "UnregisterHook", see API.txt for more information.

Fixes
* Fixed a rare crash that could occur when interacting with parameters in callbacks passed to "RegisterHook".
* Fixed a bug that caused an occasional crash on startup.
