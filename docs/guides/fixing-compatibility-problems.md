# Fixing missing AOBs

If UE4SS won't properly start because of missing AOBs, you can provide your own AOB and callback using Lua.

For this guide you'll need to know what a `root directory` and `working directory` is.
A `root directory` is always the directory that contains `ue4ss.dll`.
A `working directory` is either the directory that contains `ue4ss.dll` OR a game specific directory, for example `<root directory>/SatisfactoryEarlyAccess`.

## How to find AOBs

Since the process is quite complicated, here will just cover the general steps you need to take.

1. Make a blank shipped game in your game's UE version, with PDBs
2. Read game's memory using x64dbg
3. Look for the signature you need - those can be found [below](#what-onmatchfound-must-return-for-each-aob)
4. Grab a copy of the bytes from that function, sometimes the header is enough. If it is not, it may be better to grab a call to the function and if it's not a virtual function, you can grab the RIP address there
5. Open your game's memory in x64dbg and search it for the same block of bytes
6. If you find it, you can use the [swiss army knife](https://github.com/Nukem9/SwissArmyKnife) tool to extract the AOB for it which you can use in a simple script such as example [here](#example-script-simple-direct-scan)

## How to setup your own AOB and callback

1. Create the directory `UE4SS_Signatures` if it doesn't already exist in your `working directory`.
2. Identify which AOBs are broken and needs fixing.
3. Make the following files inside `UE4SS_Signatures`, depending on which AOBs are broken:
    - GUObjectArray.lua
    - FName_ToString.lua
    - FName_Constructor.lua
    - StaticConstructObject.lua
    - GMalloc.lua
4. Inside the `.lua` file you need a global `Register` function with no params
    - Keep in mind that the names of functions in Lua files in the `UE4SS_Signatures` directory are case-senstive.
5. The `Register` function must return the AOB that you want UE4SS to scan for.
    - The format is a list of nibbles, and every two forms a byte.  
    - I like putting a space between each byte just for clarity but this is not a requirement. 
    - An example of an AOB: `8B 51 04 85`.
    - Another example of an AOB: `8B510485`.
    - The AOB scanner supports wildcards for either nibble or the entire byte.
6. Next you need to create a global `OnMatchFound` function.
    - This function has one param, `MatchAddress`, and this is the address of the match.
    - It's in this function that you'll place all your logic for calculating the final address.
    - The most simple way to do this is to make sure that your AOB leads directly to the start of the final address. That way you can simply return `MatchAddress`.
    - In the event that you're doing something more advanced (e.g. indirect aob scan), UE4SS makes available two global functions, `DerefToInt32` which takes an address and returns, as a 32-bit integer, whatever data is located there OR `nil` if the address could not be dereferenced, and `print` for debugging purposes.

## What 'OnMatchFound' must return for each AOB
- GUObjectArray
   - Must return the exact address of the global variable named 'GUObjectArray'.
- FName_ToString
   - Must return the exact address of the start of the function 'FName::ToString'.  
     Function signature: `public: void cdecl FName::ToString(class FString & ptr64)const __ptr64`
- FName_Constructor
   - Must return the exact address of the start of the function 'FName::FName'.  
     This callback is likely to be called many times and we do a check behind the scenes to confirm if we found the right constructor.  
     It doesn't matter if your AOB finds both 'char*' versions and 'wchar_t*' versions.  
     Function signature: `public: cdecl FName::FName(wchar_t const * ptr64,enum EFindName) __ptr64`
- FText_Constructor
  - Must return the exact address of the start of the function 'FText::FText'.  
    Function signature: `public: cdecl FText::FText(class FString & ptr64)const __ptr64`
- StaticConstructObject
   - Must return the exact address of the start of the global function 'StaticConstructObject_Internal'.  
     In UE4SS, we scan for a call in the middle of 'UUserWidget::InitializeInputComponent' and then resolve the call location.  
     Function signature: `class UObject * __ptr64 __cdecl StaticConstructObject_Internal(struct FStaticConstructObjectParameters const & __ptr64)`
- GMalloc
     - Must return the exact address of the global variable named 'GMalloc'.  
     In UE4SS, we scan for 'FMemory::Free' and then resolve the MOV instruction closest to the first CALL instruction.

## Example script (Simple, direct scan)

```lua
function Register()
    return "48 8B C4 57 48 83 EC 70 80 3D ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 48 89"
end

function OnMatchFound(MatchAddress)
    return MatchAddress
end
```

## Example script (Advanced, indirect scan)

```lua
function Register()
    return "41 B8 01 00 00 00 48 8D 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? 48 8D 0D ?? ?? ?? ?? E9"
end

function OnMatchFound(MatchAddress)
    local InstrSize = 0x05

    local JmpInstr = MatchAddress + 0x14
    local Offset = DerefToInt32(JmpInstr + 0x1)
    local Destination = JmpInstr + Offset + InstrSize

    return Destination
end
```
