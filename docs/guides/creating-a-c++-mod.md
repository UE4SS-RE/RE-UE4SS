# Creating a C++ mod

This guide will help you create a C++ mod using UE4SS.  
It's split up into four parts.  
Part one goes over the prerequisites.  
Part two goes over creating the most basic C++ mod possible.  
Part three will show you how to interact with UE4SS and UE itself (via UE4SS).  
Part four will cover installation of the mod.

> The guide requires having a working C++ development environment with `cmake` and `git`, preferably similar to the one required to build UE4SS itself from sources.

## Part 1
1. Make an Epic account and link it to your GitHub account
2. Check your email and accept the invitation to the @EpicGames GitHub organization for Unreal source access.
3. Make a directory somewhere on your computer, the name doesn't matter but I named mine `MyMods`.
4. Clone the RE-UE4SS repo so that you end up with `MyMods/RE-UE4SS`.
5. Open CMD and cd into `RE-UE4SS` and execute: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
6. Go back to the `MyMods` directory and create a new directory, this directory will contain your mod source files.
I named mine `MyAwesomeMod`.
7. Create a file called `CMakeLists.txt` inside `MyMods` and put this inside it:
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18)

project(MyMods)

add_subdirectory(RE-UE4SS)
add_subdirectory(MyAwesomeMod)
```

## Part #2
1. Create a file called `CMakeLists.txt` inside `MyMods/MyAwesomeMod` and put this inside it:
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18)

set(TARGET MyAwesomeMod)
project(${TARGET})

add_library(${TARGET} SHARED "dllmain.cpp")
target_include_directories(${TARGET} PRIVATE .)
target_link_libraries(${TARGET} PUBLIC UE4SS)
```
2. Make a file called `dllmain.cpp` in `MyMods/MyAwesomeMod` and put this inside it:
```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <Mod/CppUserModBase.hpp>

class MyAwesomeMod : public RC::CppUserModBase
{
public:
    MyAwesomeMod() : CppUserModBase()
    {
        ModName = STR("MyAwesomeMod");
        ModVersion = STR("1.0");
        ModDescription = STR("This is my awesome mod");
        ModAuthors = STR("UE4SS Team");
        // Do not change this unless you want to target a UE4SS version
        // other than the one you're currently building with somehow.
        //ModIntendedSDKVersion = STR("2.6");
        
        printf("MyAwesomeMod says hello\n");
    }

    ~MyAwesomeMod() override
    {
    }

    auto on_update() -> void override
    {
    }
};

#define MY_AWESOME_MOD_API __declspec(dllexport)
extern "C"
{
    MY_AWESOME_MOD_API RC::CppUserModBase* start_mod()
    {
        return new MyAwesomeMod();
    }

    MY_AWESOME_MOD_API void uninstall_mod(RC::CppUserModBase* mod)
    {
        delete mod;
    }
}
```
3. In the command prompt, in the `MyMods` directory, execute: `cmake -S . -B Output`
4. Open `MyMods/Output/MyMods.sln`
5. Make sure that you're set to the `Release` configuration unless you want to debug.
6. Find your project (in my case: MyAwesomeMod) in the solution explorer and right click it and hit `Build`.

## Part #3
In this part, we're going to learn how to log to file, and both consoles, as well as find a UObject by name, and log that name.
1. Add `#include <DynamicOutput/DynamicOutput.hpp>` under `#include <Mod/CppUserModBase.hpp>`.  
You can now also remove `#include <stdio.h>` because we'll be removing the use of `printf` which was the only thing that required it.
2. To save some time and annoyance and make the code look a bit better, add this line below all the includes:
```c++
using namespace RC;
```
3. Replace the call to printf in the body of the `MyAwesomeMod` constructor with:
```c++
Output::send<LogLevel::Verbose>(STR("MyAwesomeMod says hello\n"));
```
It's longer than a call to `printf`, but in return the message gets propagated to the log file and both the regular console and the GUI console.  
We also get some support for colors via the `LogLevel` enum.

4. Add this below the DynamicOutput include:
```c++
#include <Unreal/UObjectGlobals.hpp>
#include <Unreal/UObject.hpp>
```
5. Let's again utilize the `using namespace` shortcut by adding this below the first one: `using namespace RC::Unreal;`
6. Add this function in your mod class:
```c++
auto on_unreal_init() -> void override
{
    // You are allowed to use the 'Unreal' namespace in this function and anywhere else after this function has fired.
    auto Object = UObjectGlobals::StaticFindObject<UObject*>(nullptr, nullptr, STR("/Script/CoreUObject.Object"));
    Output::send<LogLevel::Verbose>(STR("Object Name: {}\n"), Object->GetFullName());
}
```
Note that `Output::send` doesn't require a `LogLevel` and that we're using `{}` in the format string instead of `%s`.  
The `Output::send` function uses `std::format` in the back-end so you should do some research around std::format or libfmt if you want to know more about it.

7. Right click your project and hit `Build`.
