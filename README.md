## Targeting UE Versions: From 4.12 To 5.3

The goal of UE4SS is not to be a plug-n-play solution that always works with every game.
The goal is to have an underlying system that works for most games.
You may need to update AOBs on your own, and there's a guide for that below.

## Basic Installation

The easiest installation is via downloading the non-dev version of the latest non-experimental build from [Releases](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases) and extracting the zip content to `/{Gameroot}/GameName/Binaries/Win64/`.

If your game is in the custom config list, extract the contents from the relevant folder to `Win64` as well.

If you are planning on doing mod development using UE4SS, you can do the same as above but download the zDEV version instead.

## Build requirements

- A computer running Windows.
  - Linux support might happen at some point but not soon.
- A version of MSVC that supports C++23:
  - MSVC toolset version >= 14.39.0
  - MSVC version >= 19.39.0
  - Visual Studio version >= 17.9
  - More compilers will hopefully be supported in the future.
- [Rust toolchain >= 1.73.0](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [xmake >= 2.9.3](https://xmake.io/#/)

## Build instructions

1. Clone the repo.
2. Execute this command: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
    Make sure your Github account is linked to your Epic Games account for UE source access.
    Do not use the `--remote` option because that will force third-party dependencies to update to the latest commit, and that can break things.
    You will need your github account to be linked to an Epic games account to pull the Unreal pseudo code submodule.

There are several different ways you can build UE4SS.

## Building from cli

### Configuration settings

`xmake` allows you to flexibly configure some build options to suit your specific needs. The following is a non-comprehensive list of configuration settings you might find useful.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All configuration changes are made by using the `xmake config` command. You can also use `xmake f` as an alias for con**f**ig. 

After configuring `xmake` with any of the following options, you can build the project with `xmake` or `xmake build`.

#### Mode

The build modes are structured as follows: `<Target>__<Config>__<Platform>`

Currently supported options for these are:

* `Target`
  * `Game` - for regular games on UE versions greater than UE 4.21
  * `LessEqual421` - for regular games on UE versions less than or equal to UE 4.21
  * `CasePreserving` - for games built with case preserving enabled

* `Config`
  * `Dev` - development build
  * `Debug` - debug build
  * `Shipping` - shipping(release) build
  * `Test` - build for tests

* `Platform`
  * `Win64` - 64-bit windows

> [!TIP]
> Configure the project using this command: `xmake f -m "<BuildMode>"`. `-m` is an alias for --**m**ode=\<BuildMode>.

#### Patternsleuth (Experimental)

By default, the patternsleuth tool installs itself as an xmake package. If you do not intend on modifying the patternsleuth source code, then you don't have to configure anything special. If you want to be able to modify the patternsleuth source code, you have to supply the `--patternsleuth=local` option to `xmake config` in order to recompile patternsleuth as part of the UE4SS build. 

#### Proxy Path

By default, UE4SS generates a proxy based on `C:\Windows\System32\dwmapi.dll`. If you want to change this for any reason, you can supply the `--ue4ssProxyPath=<path proxy dll>` to the `xmake config` command..

#### Profiler Flavor

By default, UE4SS uses Tracy for profiling. You can pass `--profilerFlavor=<profiler>` to the `xmake config` command to set the profiler flavor. The currently supported flavors are `Tracy`, `Superluminal`, and `None`.

#### Version Check

By default, xmake will check if you have the minimum required version of Rust or MSVC installed (if you are using the MSVC toolchain). If you do not, it will throw an error on the configure step. If you want to ignore this check, you can pass `--versionCheck=n` to the `xmake config` command.

Once you set the flag, the option value be set until you specify otherwise.

Therefore, to not check versions when running `xmake project -k vsxmake2022`, you must first run the `xmake config --versionCheck=n` command, then run the `xmake project -k vsxmake2022` command.

### Helpful `xmake` commands

You may encounter use for the some of the more advanced `xmake` commands. A non-comprehensive list of some useful commands is included below.

| Syntax | Aliases | Uses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `xmake <command> --yes` | `xmake <command> -y` | Automatically confirm any user prompts. |
| `xmake --verbose <command>` | `xmake -v <command>` | Enable verbose level logging. |
| `xmake --Diagnostic <command>` | `xmake -D <command>` | Enable diagnostic level logging. |
| `xmake --verbose --Diagnostic --yes <command>` | `xmake -vDy <command>` | You can combine most flags into a single `-flagCombo`. |
| `xmake config` | `xmake f` | Configure xmake with any of [these options](#configuration-settings). |
| `xmake clean --all` | `xmake c --all` | Cleans binaries and intermediate output of all targets. |
| `xmake clean <target>` | `xmake c <target>` | Cleans binaries and intermediates of a specific target. |
| `xmake build` | `xmake b` | Incrementally builds UE4SS using input file detection. |
| `xmake build --rebuild` | `xmake b -r` | Forces a full rebuild of UE4SS. |
| `xmake build <target>` | `xmake b <target>` | Incrementally builds a specific target. |
| `xmake show` | | Shows xmake info and current project info. |
| `xmake show --target=<target>` | `xmake show -t <target>` | Prints lots of information about a target. Useful for debugging scripts, compiler flags, dependency tree, etc. |
| `xmake require --clean` | `xmake q -c` | Clears all package caches and uninstalls all not-referenced packages. |
| `xmake require --force` | `xmake q -f` | Force re-installs all dependency packages. |
| `xmake require --list` | `xmake q -l` | Lists all packages that are needed for the project. |
| `xmake project --kind=vsxmake2022 --modes="Game__Shipping__Win64"` | `xmake project -k vsxmake2022 -m "Game__Shipping__Win64"` | Generates a [Visual Studio project](#visual-studio--rider) based on your current `xmake config`uration. You can specify multiple modes to generate by supplying `-m "Comma,Separated,Modes"`. If you do not supply any modes, the VS project will generate all [permutations of modes](#mode). |

### Opening in an IDE

#### Visual Studio / Rider

To generate Visual Studio project files, run the `xmake project -k vsxmake2022 -m "Game__Shipping__Win64"` command.

Afterwards open the generated `.sln` file inside of the `vsxmake2022` directory

Note that you should also commit & push the submodules that you've updated if the reason why you updated was not because someone else pushed an update, and you're just catching up to it.

> [!WARNING]
> The vs. build plugin performs the compile operation by directly calling the xmake command under vs, and also supports intellisense and definition jumps, as well as breakpoint debugging.
> This means that modifying the project properties within Visual Studio will not affect which flags are passed to the build when VS executes `xmake`. XMake provides some configurable project settings which can be found in VS under the `Project Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Xmake` menu.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you have multiple Visual Studio versions installed, run `xmake f --vs=2022`, otherwise you may encounter issues with the project generation.

##### Configuring additional modes

> [!TIP]
> Additional modes can be generated by running `xmake project -k vsxmake2022 -m "Game__Shipping__Win64,Game__Debug__Win64"`.
> [Further explanation can be found in the `xmake` command table](#helpful-xmake-commands).

##### Regenerating solution best practices

> [!CAUTION]
> If you change your configuration with `xmake config`, you *may* need to regenerate your Visual Studio solution to pick up on changes to your configuration. You can simply re-run the `xmake project -k vsxmake2022 -m "<modes>"` command to regenerate the solution.

## Updating git submodules

If you want to update git submodules, you do so one of three ways:
1. You can execute `git submodule update --init --recursive` to update all submodules.
2. You can also choose to update submodules one by one, by executing `git submodule update --init --recursive deps/<first-or-third>/<Repo>`.
    Do not use the `--remote` option unless you actually want to update to the latest commit.
3. If you would rather pick a specific commit or branch to update a submodule to then `cd` into the submodule directory for that dependency and execute `git checkout <branch name or commit>`.
The main dependency you might want to update from time to time is `deps/first/Unreal`.
